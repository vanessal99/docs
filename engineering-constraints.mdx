# Solving for Engineering Constraints

The first step is changing what you bring to engineering. Most CSMs escalate customer urgency as-is - "this customer really needs X." That's not useful. Engineering needs context: what's the ARR at risk, what's actually blocked, and what happens if this doesn't get built this quarter. A CSM who brings the data - ARR at risk, health score trends, Assistant gap patterns, expansion blockers - gives engineering what they need to prioritize without guessing.

The second layer is reducing the need to go to engineering at all. Mintlify's platform is flexible - custom CSS, custom JS, reusable snippets, components. A CSM who knows the product deeply enough can often solve what a customer is asking for without a single engineering ticket. In my current role, I've built that trust with engineering over time, and as I've proven my technical ability, I've been able to make changes directly. That's the model I'd bring here - be the CSM who solves problems first, and only escalates what truly requires new code.

<Tip>
  The most valuable CSM isn't the one who escalates the loudest. It's the one who makes engineering's job easier - by bringing sharp context when escalation is needed, and handling what they can on their own when it's not.
