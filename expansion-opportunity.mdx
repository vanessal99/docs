# The Opportunity: Additional Sites

Coinbase's CDP docs site serves fundamentally different audiences through a single subscription. The expansion opportunity is splitting it into purpose-built sites - which creates a better experience for Coinbase and additional revenue for Mintlify.

  <Accordion title="What the split looks like">
    Coinbase's Institutional APIs - Exchange, International Exchange, Prime, Derivatives —-serve sophisticated financial institutions, not indie developers building wallet apps. A dedicated Mintlify site could have tailored navigation, gated access via Mintlify's authentication features, and a scoped AI Assistant trained only on institutional content. The same logic applies to internal engineering docs if they're currently housed elsewhere. (Link to mintlify.com/blog/mintlify-for-enterprise)

  <Accordion title="Why this is better for Coinbase">
    Institutional partners get a cleaner onboarding path. The AI Assistant gives more accurate answers because it's scoped to relevant content instead of the entire CDP corpus. Coinbase gets separate analytics per audience - they can measure institutional developer engagement independently. And if partner engineering is spending time on manual onboarding, a dedicated self-serve docs site with a scoped Assistant could reduce that load meaningfully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What this looks like in revenue terms">
    Assuming Coinbase's current Enterprise subscription is ~\$30K ARR, a second site for Institutional APIs at the same tier doubles the account to ~\$60K - taking NRR on this account from 100% to 200%. A third site for internal docs would push it further. Each additional site also brings its own seat growth and AI Assistant usage. For a CSM managing a portfolio, turning one \$30K account into a \$60-90K account through a single well-timed recommendation is exactly the kind of expansion that compounds across a book of business.

# Why They Haven't Done This Yet?

Coinbase migrated to Mintlify in 2025 and spent their initial energy fixing information architecture, activating AI features, and getting preview builds from 30 minutes to under a minute. Splitting into multiple sites is a phase two optimization - you don't do it while stabilizing the first site. Additionally, without someone showing them the data on how institutional and consumer audiences behave differently on the same site, this likely hasn't surfaced as a priority yet.
