# What Makes Mintlify Sticky & How to Use It

A feature is sticky when switching away from it is painful. Our job is to deepen engagement with these features early - so that by renewal, leaving isn't a realistic option.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Docs-as-Code Git Workflow">
    Once a customer's docs live in GitHub synced with Mintlify - with PR reviews, preview deployments, and CI/CD baked in - their entire publishing workflow depends on it. Migrating means rebuilding all of that. The churn prevention play: expand the number of people using this workflow. A single engineer editing docs is a weak anchor. A team of engineers, PMs, and writers all committing through the same repo is a deep one. Every new contributor raises the switching cost.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI Assistant Analytics">
    The Assistant isn't just a chatbot - it builds institutional knowledge over time. The Categories tab reveals what end users are struggling with, conversation history shows patterns, and usage data informs content decisions. That insight doesn't transfer to a competitor. The churn prevention play: get the Assistant turned on early and show customers their own data after 30 days. Once they're using those insights to improve their docs, they're hooked on a feedback loop they can't replicate elsewhere.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI-Native Distribution (LLMs.txt & MCP)">
    This is the emerging sticky layer. Once docs are optimized for AI consumption, the customer's product becomes discoverable in tools like Cursor, Claude, and ChatGPT. That's not just documentation anymore - it's a distribution channel. The churn prevention play: educate customers on this vision early. A customer who sees Mintlify as their AI distribution strategy won't leave for a tool that just publishes pretty pages.

<Tip>
  The best churn prevention doesn't happen at renewal. It happens months earlier when a CSM deepens engagement with these features. By the time renewal starts, it should already be a non-question.
