This site contains my take-home assessment for the Enterprise Customer Success Manager role at Mintlify. I've organized my work into two sections:

<Card icon="rocket" horizontal href="/quickstart" title="Task 1: Building CS 0-1">
  My framework for building Mintlify's customer success infrastructure, including the metrics I'd track, how I'd drive expansion, and how I think about retention and prioritization.
</Card>

<Card icon="chart-line" horizontal href="/quickstart" title="Task 2: Customer Expansion">
  A deep dive into a specific Mintlify customer, analyzing how they're using the product today and where the expansion opportunity lies.
</Card>

My approach was grounded in studying Mintlify's product, pricing, customers, roadmap, and blog to build recommendations that reflect how the product actually creates value - for both human developers and the AI agents that are increasingly consuming documentation.
