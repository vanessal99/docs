# What Stands Out About Coinbase's Docs

Coinbase is one of Mintlify's most AI-activated customers. They migrated from Docusaurus in 2025 and went all-in - not just on the platform, but on Mintlify's vision for where documentation is headed.

  <Accordion title="They treat docs like a product, not a support tool">
    Coinbase PM Alex Hu led the migration and wrote a public blog about it. He ran usability tests with real developers at ETHDenver, watched them struggle with the old docs, and used those findings to rebuild the entire information architecture. That's product thinking applied to documentation - not something most companies do. (Link to coinbase.com/blog/Coinbase-PM-Blog-AI-Docs-and-Mintlify)

  <Accordion title="They've activated every AI feature Mintlify offers">
    LLMs.txt, MCP server (`npx mint-mcp add coinbase`), built-in AI Assistant, one-click export to Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT, and an interactive API playground. Kevin Leffew, their AI GTM Lead, said publicly: "AI-native docs aren't just helpful - they're now essential." This is a customer who isn't experimenting with AI features - they've committed.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cross-functional buy-in, not a single-owner account">
    The PM blog credits 10+ contributors by name across product, engineering, and developer relations. Docs at Coinbase aren't one engineer's side project - they're a cross-functional investment. That's the kind of organizational buy-in that makes an account sticky and expandable.

  <Accordion title="The docs site itself is massive - and that's the problem">
    Looking at [docs.cdp.coinbase.com](http://docs.cdp.coinbase.com), the site covers Payments, Trading, Wallets, Onchain Tools, Consumer APIs, Business APIs, and Institutional APIs - plus separate tabs for API Reference, SDKs, Demo Apps, and Changelogs. They fixed their IA problems from the Docusaurus era, but they've packed fundamentally different audiences into a single site. A retail developer building a wallet and an institutional client integrating Prime custody are navigating the same sidebar. (Link to [docs.cdp.coinbase.com](http://docs.cdp.coinbase.com))
