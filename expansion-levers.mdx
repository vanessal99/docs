# The Levers

Looking at Mintlify's pricing structure, I see five natural expansion levers. What makes these effective is that each one is tied to the customer getting more value - expansion is a byproduct of success, not a sales motion.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hobby → Pro">
    Trigger: customer adds a second editor or wants AI Assistant. Best candidates are Hobby users already publishing consistently with real traffic - they've proven value, they just need the team and AI layer. The 14-day free trial lowers the barrier here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pro → Enterprise">
    Trigger: security review requires SSO, compliance needs an uptime SLA, or the org outgrows basic permissions and needs RBAC. These are usually hard requirements from procurement or security teams, not optional upgrades. ([Link to mintlify.com/blog/mintlify-for-enterprise](https://mintlify.com/blog/mintlify-for-enterprise))
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Editor Seat Growth">
    Pro includes 5 seats at \$20/seat overage. As non-engineers - PMs, writers, marketers - discover the web editor, seat count grows quietly and consistently. A customer going from 5 to 10 editors adds \$100/month - \$1,200/year. Across a book of 50 accounts, even modest average growth of 3 extra seats per account adds \$36,000/year in expansion revenue. This is probably the most underrated lever because it compounds without needing a big upgrade conversation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI Assistant Overages">
    250 messages included on Pro, \$0.25 per overage. A customer with 1,000 monthly overage queries generates \$250/month - \$3,000/year - effectively doubling their Pro subscription cost. The key insight: this lever grows based on the customer's end users, not the customer themselves - which means it scales with their product adoption.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Additional Sites">
    Each subscription covers one docs site. Companies with multiple products, or separate internal and external docs, need additional subscriptions. Zapier is a good example - they run both internal engineering docs and public developer docs on Mintlify. ([Link to mintlify.com/customers/zapier](https://mintlify.com/customers/zapier))

# Driving It Systematically

Expansion breaks down when it relies on CSM intuition instead of repeatable signals. The goal is to build a system where the right conversations happen at the right time, across every account.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Usage-Based Triggers">
    Define specific thresholds that flag accounts for expansion conversations. A Hobby customer publishing weekly with growing traffic → Pro conversation. A Pro account activating a 4th or 5th editor seat → team onboarding outreach before they hit overages by surprise. AI Assistant usage crossing 200 of 250 included messages → heads-up conversation that reframes the overage as a sign their docs are working, not a cost problem. These triggers should live in a shared dashboard so every CSM is working from the same signals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Let Customer Stories Do the Selling">
    Mintlify has very strong case studies - HubSpot cutting engineering resources by 50%, Coinbase achieving 50x faster deployment, Lovable scaling support for millions of users with a lean team. These aren't just marketing material - they're expansion tools. When a Pro customer is hesitant about Enterprise, showing them how a similar company got ROI from the upgrade is more persuasive than any feature comparison. We should be fluent in these stories and match them to the customer's industry and stage.

<Tip>
  The best expansion doesn't feel like a pitch. We can show a customer their own usage data and say "here's what's working - here's how to get more of it."
