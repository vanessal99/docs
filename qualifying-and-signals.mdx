# Qualifying the Opportunity

Before bringing this to Coinbase, I'd need to answer three questions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is institutional traffic significant enough to justify a separate site?">
    Mintlify's analytics can show whether Exchange, Prime, and Derivatives pages get meaningful traffic. If institutional partners aren't using the docs, the problem is discoverability - not site architecture. The data has to show a real audience before recommending a split.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is partner onboarding currently a pain point?">
    If Coinbase's partner engineering team is spending significant time walking institutional clients through integrations manually, a dedicated docs site with a scoped AI Assistant is a measurable cost savings. If onboarding is already smooth, urgency drops.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there an internal champion on the institutional side?">
    The CDP team led the migration, but institutional APIs serve a different part of the business. Without a stakeholder on that side - someone in institutional partnerships or enterprise sales - who'd sponsor the project, the recommendation stalls.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Readiness Signals

I'd watch for these before initiating the conversation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Assistant data shows distinct audience clusters">
    If the Categories tab reveals institutional integration questions mixed in with basic consumer questions, that's evidence the audiences are different enough to warrant separation - and I'd bring that data to the conversation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coinbase asks about gating or authentication">
    If anyone at Coinbase mentions restricting access to partner-only docs or NDA-protected API references, that's a direct signal. A separate site with Mintlify's enterprise authentication is the cleanest solution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The migration dust has settled">
    Publishing velocity is stable, the team is comfortable with Mintlify workflows, and they're not in "fix and stabilize" mode anymore. That's when they have bandwidth for optimization - and when this conversation lands.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  The best time to bring this up is during a usage review where you can show the data: 'Here's how your institutional audience uses your docs differently from your developer audience.'
